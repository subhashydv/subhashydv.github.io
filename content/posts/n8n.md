## About n8n : 

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect apps, APIs, and services using a visual interface, but more powerful and developer-friendly.

TIP : Its Just an advanced version of jenkins or any automation pipeline. where these automation tool allows us to write scripts and integrate the workflow where n8n directly allows us to integrate applications and tools.

### What I can achieve with n8n : 

  - Automate repetitive tasks between services (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Google Sheets).
  - Integrate APIs without writing full apps.
  - Create workflows with logic, conditionals, and transformations.
  - Self-host workflows securely (open source).


### Example use cases : 

- Send a Slack/gchat/whatsapp alert when a new GitHub issue is created. (Github Trigger -> Slack)
- Receive an email when a form is submitted on your website. (Webhook node -> Email)
- Create and upload a video on youtube based on provided description. (Google Sheet or Form node -> AI Agent -> Google Veo -> Youtube upload node)

### How I can use it : 

There are 2 main way to use it - 
1. Install it on local (comes free of cost)

#### STEP 1 : Start your docker on local

Use your command or launching way to start docker.

#### STEP 2 : Pull the docker image

docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

#### STEP 4 : Visit the following url 

[Link https://localhost:5678](https://localhost:5678)

NOTE : This url will ask you to sign up first. once you sign up you can start creating your workflow and explore the interface it provides.
