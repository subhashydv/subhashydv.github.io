## About Game

#### Objective

The objective of the game is to strategies and find the details of the murder, the cards in the envelope.

## Rules

In the start of the game, three cards one suspect, one room, and one weapon are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, so that no one can see them. These cards contains the answer. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players.

Player can roll dice and enter in room that is has path to reach.
As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect the room they are in and weapon.

The player's suggestions must include the room they are currently in and may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room, if they are not both already present. Suggesting an opponent's token is a legitimate board strategy. A player may even suggest himself or herself as the murderer and may include cards in their own hand.

Once a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to the current player. Otherwise, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the accusation, or no one can do so. A player's turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed.


## Winning or Losing

A player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion. The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. 

### Win
If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins.

### Lose
if not, the player returns them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game; in effect, "losing".


``If someone wins than game ends else remaining players can continue...``
